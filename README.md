# Purpose
Our work focuses on assessing the genomic basis of convergent evolution in mimetic butterflies and moths that diverged between 1 and 120 million years ago. Specifically, we aim to investigate whether similar wing colour patterns that have evolved repeatedly across these species arise from shared genetic mechanisms or through different evolutionary pathways. By studying multiple distantly related species exhibiting mimicry, this project seeks to deepen our understanding of how natural selection and genetic constraints influence the evolution of convergent phenotypes across recent vs deep evolutionary timescales.
